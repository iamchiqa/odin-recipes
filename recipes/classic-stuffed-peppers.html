        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 c. uncooked white or brown rice</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (14.5-oz.) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp. dried oregano</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>6 bell peppers, tops and cores removed</li>
            <li>1 c. shredded Monterey jack</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh parsley, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400°. In a small saucepan, prepare rice according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 7 minutes. Stir in garlic and tomato paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add ground beef and cook, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Drain excess fat.</li>
            <li>Stir in rice and diced tomatoes; season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Arrange peppers cut side up in a 13"x9" baking dish and drizzle with oil. Spoon beef mixture into each pepper. Top with cheese, then cover baking dish with foil.</li>
            <li>Bake peppers until tender, about 35 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until cheese is bubbly, about 10 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Top with parsley before serving.</li>
        </ol>
